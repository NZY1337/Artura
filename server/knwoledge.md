# open ai API call

- To transfer files from frontend â†’ backend, we use Multer.
- Multer stores uploaded images in memory as Buffer objects.
- To send these images from the server to OpenAI's image API, we use the toFile() utility from  the OpenAI SDK.
- When using Multer:
- We pass each file.buffer (from req.files) into toFile(...).
- This converts the in-memory buffer into a File-like object compatible with OpenAI's API.
- The code in the OpenAI documentation (below) assumes that image files are already on disk:
    # where all the imageFiles are importend from local file system (fs) - not from memory
    const imageFiles = [
        "bath-bomb.png",
        "body-lotion.png",
        "incense-kit.png",
        "soap.png",
    ];

    const images = await Promise.all(
        imageFiles.map(async (file) =>
            await toFile(fs.createReadStream(file), null, {
                type: "image/png",
            })
        ),
    );

 - How Long Do Uploaded Files Stay in Memory?
    * ðŸ•’ Only for the duration of that HTTP request.
    * Once your handler/controller finishes processing (e.g., sending to OpenAI), the request  ends and the Buffer is garbage collected.
    * So it doesn't persist across requests, nor is it stored in disk or database.
