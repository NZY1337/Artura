# Understanding GPT-image-1 Pricing
OpenAI's GPT-image-1 model employs a token-based pricing structure, with distinct rates for different token types:

Text Input Tokens: $5.00 per 1 million tokens
Image Input Tokens: $10.00 per 1 million tokens
Image Output Tokens: $40.00 per 1 million tokens
These rates apply to the respective token counts in each API call. 

# Billing Clients: Credit-Based System
Implementing a credit-based billing system can offer flexibility and transparency to your clients. Here's how you can structure it:

Define Credit Value:
Assign a monetary value to each credit (e.g., 1 credit = $0.01).

Calculate Token Costs in Credits:
Text Input: (Number of text input tokens / 1,000,000) Ã— $5.00
Image Input: (Number of image input tokens / 1,000,000) Ã— $10.00
Image Output: (Number of image output tokens / 1,000,000) Ã— $40.00

Convert these costs to credits based on your defined credit value. Clients purchase credits in advance (e.g., $10 for 1,000 credits).

# Deduct Credits per Usage:
For each image generation, deduct the corresponding number of credits based on token usage.
Monitor and Notify:
Implement a system to monitor credit balances and notify clients when their balance is low.

ðŸ“Š Example Calculation
Assuming a client generates an image with the following token usage:

Text Input Tokens: 200
Image Input Tokens: 1,800
Image Output Tokens: 1,000

# Calculate the cost:

Text Input Cost: (200 / 1,000,000) Ã— $5.00 = $0.001
Image Input Cost: (1,800 / 1,000,000) Ã— $10.00 = $0.018
Image Output Cost: (1,000 / 1,000,000) Ã— $40.00 = $0.040

Total Cost: $0.001 + $0.018 + $0.040 = $0.059

Convert to credits (1 credit = $0.01): Total Credits Deducted: $0.059 / $0.01 = 5.9 credits (round up to 6 credits)

ðŸ›’ Client Credit Purchase Options
Offer clients the ability to purchase credits in various packages:
OpenAI

Basic Package: $10 for 1,000 credits
Standard Package: $50 for 5,500 credits (10% bonus)
Premium Package: $100 for 12,000 credits (20% bonus)

This tiered system incentivizes larger purchases and provides flexibility for different usage levels.

ðŸ”„ Handling Cached Inputs
If your system utilizes caching mechanisms to reuse previous inputs, you can offer discounted rates for cached content:

Cached Text Input Tokens: $1.25 per 1 million tokens
Cached Image Input Tokens: $2.50 per 1 million tokens
Adjust the credit deductions accordingly when cached inputs are used.

ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring and Reporting
Implement dashboards for clients to:
